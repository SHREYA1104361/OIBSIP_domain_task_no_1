# Iris Flower Classification Project 

##  Project Description

The Iris flower dataset is a classic and simple multivariate dataset often used for classification problems in machine learning. The challenge is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify an Iris flower into one of the three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** â€” based solely on its physical dimensions: **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

##  Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor**
- **Iris Virginica**

based on four key features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

This is a fundamental **classification problem** in supervised learning and serves as an ideal introduction to machine learning.

## ðŸ§¾ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
- Converted the dataset into a Pandas `DataFrame` for easier manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used visual and statistical techniques to understand the data:
- Histograms
- Pairplots
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Box Plots

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing/null values.
- Encoded the target labels using `LabelEncoder`.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

### 4. Model Training
Trained and compared several classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- XGBoost

### 5. Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated based on:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 6. Visualization
Visualized results using:
- Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- Classification Outcome Charts
- (Optional) Decision Boundaries
